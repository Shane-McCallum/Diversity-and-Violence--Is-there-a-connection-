# Diversity-and-Violence-correlation-Capstone
 In this capstone, I hope  to see if there exist a strong relationship between the level of diversity in a US county and the rate of violent crime, as reported to the FBI. If there is, I will attempt to develope a model that can predict the level of violent crime within a county if given the level of diversity.
